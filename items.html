<h2>There are a lot of items so there are only mythic items  from this season:</h2>
  <p>
Valeria’s Hyper SMG: This SMG’s redeeming quality is how surprisingly good it is at ranged damage1.
  Diamond Heart’</p>
  <p> Enforcer AR: A traditional assault rifle. There’s room for innovation in the workbench, but it’s still a solid weapon1.</p>
  <p>Sniper: This sniper can one-shot enemies and fire two shots without reloading, even without mods. It’s capable of annihilating anyone that comes into sight1.</p> 
  Totally Peter’s Ranger Pistol: <p> don’t get enough love in Fortnite, but the Totally Peter’s Ranger Pistol is surprisingly strong, especially if it’s Peter’s mythic1.</p>
  Peter Griffin’s Hammer Pump Shotgun: <p>Hammer Pump Shotgun is among the best new weapons in the Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1 Underground. It’s a hard-hitter with ranges, but that can be improved with weapon mods1.</p> 
  Oscar’s Frenzy Auto-Shotgun: <p>The Frenzy Shotgun is a solid second-best to the Pump Shotgun. It’s not bad, but it can’t take the spotlight due to a weaker damage output1.</p> 
  Nisha’s Striker AR:<p>The Striker is the least favorite AR in Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 1, mostly because it takes a lot of effort behind the workbench to get it up and running1.</p>
